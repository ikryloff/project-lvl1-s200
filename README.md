Welcome to my BrainGames (version 0.1.16)!
There are some simple games for you!
1. To install it global use the command:
npm install -g bgames_ikryloff
2. After installation you can run one of the game by command:
- brain-gcd (find great common divisor)
- brain-even (guess if the number is iven or odd)
- brain-prime (guess if the number is prime)
- brain-progression (guess the number in progression)
- brain-calc (guess the number like a calculator)
3. Thank you for your feedback on my Email: ikryloff@yandex.ru
